# Telangana-Growth-Analysis
This project entails conducting Exploratory Data Analysis on Telangana's economic growth. Leveraging knowledge from Google's Courses:
- Foundations of Data Science 
- Get Started with Python
- Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights
- The Power of Statistics

I utilized `Jupyter Notebook`, `Python`, and libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and visualization tools like `matplotlib` and `seaborn`. The analysis involved data cleaning, structuring, web scraping for additional insights, identifying outliers, and applying both descriptive and inferential statistics.
